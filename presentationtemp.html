    My website project, 9Net , made by Jacob. 
</h1>

<h1>Why did I decide to make a website?</h1>


<ul>
    <li>To learn something new.</li>
    <li>Greater freedom.</li>
    <li>Easily done at home.</li>
    <li>Make something fun and cool!</li>


</ul>

<h1>My Mentor.</h1>



<h2>I had an obvious choice when it came to my mentor. That would be my sister, Madison Brummett. She is ten years older than me, with plenty more than 10 years of experiance. She owns her on website. 
   <br><br> Some of the things my mentor is knowledgeable about is: HTML, CSS, C++, python, javascript, ect.</h2>

<h1>
What I had planned
</h1>

<h2>
    I didn't have much planned becausee I knew literaly nothing about HTML and CSS at the time. 
    I knew I needed an editor like Studio Visual Code or Notepad++.
     I decided to go with Visual Studio Code when I started. 
     I also knew that I had an asenal of information that I could learn online.
     I had all the supplies I needed, I just had to learn.
</h2>

<h1>
    So what is HTML?
</h1>

<ul>
<li>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language.</li>
<li>Is the backbone and structure of websites.</li>
<li>Text wrapped in tags. The tags change how the text function.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Now CSS</h1>

<ul>
    <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li>
    <li>Changes how elements look like and where they are positioned.</li>
    <li>Can be used either inside an HTML file or seperately in a CSS file.</li>
    </ul>
<h1>My first bit of progress.</h1>

<h2>
It was already the 23rd of October, so I knew I really needed to get started. 
I actually didn't even meet with my mentor yet but I felt like I could figure it out by some YouTube videos.<br><br>
Most of them were convoluted and confusing but I eventually found someone I liked. His YouTube name is Bro Code.
He was straightforward and clear. His courses for HTML and CSS is 1 hour each, which is very quick.<br><br>
So, I started making the demo site. I was learning so I knew better to not use it as the foundation of my final project.

<h2>At this point, I was pretty happy. I had an easy start.</h2>

<h2>After that I got some food to eat. As soon as I was done I came back to learn some more about the HTMl video. I absorbed the info and put it into the test website.

<h2>I didn't know it at the time but I actually used internal CSS to style things to look different. 
    I found it difficult to remember some things at this point which made me a bit frusterated.<br><br>
It looks like I also tried to make a rickroll but it kind of failed.</h2>
