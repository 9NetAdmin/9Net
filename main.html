 Hey what's up! Welcome. I decided I wanted to learn HTML, so I made this website. I thought it would be a useful project that I could do. Being able to make your own website from scratch is like a dream, you don't have any limitations of what you can do. I don't have much aded yet, but I plan on updating it throughout time. Hope you enjoy the website!</h3>

 <h3>I wanted to make the website look like it was from the early 2000s / late 90s. I don't really like the new format of everything looking exactly the same, it gets really boring.
